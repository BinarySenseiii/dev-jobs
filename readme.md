## My process

After reading the style guide and creating the React app, I spent the majority of the time making sure all the functional elements worked before starting any styling. For this project, at least 80% of the logic is driven by the maintenance of the 'filters' used to select the jobs to display. After that, I started styling the components which lead to a couple iterations of code revisions to add omissions and fix bugs. And once I thought the code was working as intended, I spent some time refactoring the code, removing console logs, and adding comments.

### Built with

- [Javascript Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)
- [css Bem naming convention](https://getbem.com/naming/) - for css classnames naming conventions
- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was my first solo javascript module with pure css and I learned an incredible amount abount production ready sites, it was great to code an application that split code into different components

### Continued development

This was a great Project with javascript modules and css and I will continue to focus on projects like this to keep get more experience in both of these... along with flexbox, animations, and scss.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - An invaluable resource that I use daily.
- [css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is a great resource on flexbox!
- [Javascript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)
- [stack-overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31000885/align-an-element-to-bottom-with-flexbox) - The recommendation to use 'flex-grow: 1;' was exactly what I needed to position the last flexbox element to the right side of the container.
